I am a PhD student in the [Depatemnt of Geography](https://geography.tamu.edu/) at Texas A&M University. The core of my research interests cover environmental and drinking water justice in the United States. As a critical social scientist in training, my current work investigates urban water systems as a method to explore the spatial, cultural and economic politics involved with drinking water governance in an effort to understand the realities of water insecurity in the United States. I work as a research assistant at the Texas Water Resources Institute's [Urban Water Innovation and Sustainability Hub (Urban WISH)](https://twri.tamu.edu/our-work/engaging-educating/urban-wish/) under the guidance of Dr. Wendy Jepson. 

Prior to my time at Texas A&M I worked as an environmental Technical Assistance Provider with Communities Unlimited in Knoxville, TN, a GIS Analyst for Safe Streets Campaign in Tacoma, WA, and an AmeriCorps volunteer for Federal Way, WA public schools. 

I hold a Master of Arts in Community Planning from the University of Washington, Tacoma and a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies with an emphasis in Latin American history from Abilene Christian University. 

Outside my research, you can find me taking cooking lessons from my wife, reading to my newborn, or working hard not to sweat perfusly in the Texas sun while biking to work or walking my dog. When traveling I love eating at local diners on vacation, and I might drink too much black hot coffee.
