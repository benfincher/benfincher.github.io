I am a PhD student in the [Depatemnt of Geography](https://geography.tamu.edu/) at Texas A&M University. The core of my research interest cover environmental and drinking water justice in the United States. As a critical social scientist in training, my current research work investigates urban water systems to explore the spatial and cultural and economic politics involved with drinking water governance. My time at university has led me to be part of different research projects covering the borad topic of drinking water insecurity. I work as a research assistant at the Texas Water Resources Institute;s [Urban Water Innovation and Sustainability Hub (Urban WISH)](https://twri.tamu.edu/our-work/engaging-educating/urban-wish/) under the guidance of Dr. Wendy Jepson. 

Prior to my time at Texas A&M I worked as an environmental Technical Assistance Provider with Communities Unlimited in Knoxville, TN, a GIS Analyst for Safe Streets Campaign in Tacoma, WA, and an AmeriCorps volunteer for Federal Way, WA public schools. 

I hold a Master of Arts in Community Planning from the University of Washington, Tacoma and a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies with an emphasis in Latin American history from Abilene Christian University.
