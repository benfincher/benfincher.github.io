I am a PhD student in the [Depatemnt of Geography](https://geography.tamu.edu/) at Texas A&M University. The core of my research interest cover environmental and drinking water justice in the United States. My time at university has led me to be part of different research projects covering the borad topic of drinking water insecurity. I work as a research assistant at the Texas Water Resources Institute;s [Urban Water Innovation and Sustainability Hub (Urban WISH)](https://twri.tamu.edu/our-work/engaging-educating/urban-wish/) under the guidance of Dr. Wendy Jepson. 

This website is a work-in-progress, so please check back soon as I continue to update these pages.
